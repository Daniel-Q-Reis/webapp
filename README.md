# Social Network Webapp

## Project Overview

This repository hosts the frontend application for a social network. It is designed to interact with a separate social network API, providing a visual and interactive user interface. The project is predominantly built with Go, leveraging its capabilities for serving web content, alongside HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript for the client-side experience.

## Goals

* **User Interface:** Develop a responsive and intuitive user interface for the social network.
* **API Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with the existing social network API to fetch and display data (users, posts, etc.) and handle user interactions (likes, comments, etc.).
* **Go-powered Backend:** Utilize Go for server-side rendering, routing, and potentially proxying API requests.
* **Static Assets Management:** Efficiently serve HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files.
* **Scalability & Performance:** Design with future scalability and performance in mind, especially for handling user traffic.

## Technologies Used

* **Go:** Primary backend language for web server and logic.
